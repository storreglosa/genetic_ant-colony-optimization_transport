# Genetic_algorithm_vehicle_routing

This project is an application of genetic algorithm in the context of transportation engineering. We use a genetic algorithm to solve vehicle routing problems.

Here you are going to find a brief review of the theoretical framework of this metaheuristic together with a deployment in python code. In addition, we are going to be talking about the application of this framework in transportation engineering context
